    <!--For Wk2 Part 2 Stretch #16: // ****  How to assign which is higher in a short version vs conditional I created in js file or what would be best practice?  ****
In short what is another way? Below is not what I did in assignment:
    let mostPets = 0; instead do let mostPets; ??
    if (pets <= friendsPets && mostPets + friendsPets ){
    console.log(mostPets + friendsPets);
     -->
